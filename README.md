Offsets obtained by decompiling part of the application https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/mmo/path-of-exile/poe-bots-programs/953353-gamehelper-light-version-of-poehud-exile-api.html
which is distributed as an unencrypted dll  in the form of an updatable archive, which becomes available after authorization on the site 

So I will post here, if possible, all the changes they make. 

This way it will be easier for you to keep track of the changes made to the offsets after the last patch.
